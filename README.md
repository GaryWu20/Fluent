## Resources
### General Software
- [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) 
  * For command line Git
- Text Editors/IDEs
  * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): useful text editor with lots of plugins & customization
  * [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio): IDE designed specifically for Android app development, works well with Flutter 
- UI/UX Design Tool options: 
  * [Figma](https://www.figma.com/): free web-based design tool

### Tech Stack
**Mobile Application Framework Options**
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
  * Uses [Dart](https://flutter.dev/): used less by developers than JavaScript, but has great documentation
  * Lots of built-in components
  * Released by Google
- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
  * Uses JavaScript: pretty popular with an active and established dev community
  * Less built-in components, reliant on third-party libraries
- [Article comparing Flutter and React Native](https://blog.codemagic.io/flutter-vs-react-native-a-developers-perspective/)

**Database Options**
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
  * Works well with Flutter (b/c also released by Google)
  * Real-time database, cross-platform API
  * Whole ecosystem for mobile development, also includes user authentication and text chat
  * Free up to 1 GB of storage (see plans [here](https://firebase.google.com/pricing))
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
  * Part of the popular MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS) stack
  * More advanced querying than Firebase
  * More flexible & scalable, but lacks a complete ecosystem for mobile development
  * Start with 512 MB and scale up to 5 GB for free
